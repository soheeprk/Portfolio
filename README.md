## Projects

### **Cooking With NLP: A Machine Learning Approach to Recipe Recommendation**
- Developed a recipe recommendation system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to classify and recommend recipes based on user preferences, dietary restrictions, and available ingredients.
- The project involved data cleaning and engineering, including filtering recipes, removing duplicates, and segmenting ingredients into individual words for better processing.
- Used TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for vectorization and cosine similarity to improve ingredient-based matching and handle synonyms.
- Applied K-Means clustering to categorize recipes by similar ingredients and cooking styles.
- Integrated an interactive filtering system using ipywidgets, allowing users to specify nutritional constraints, meal preferences, and ingredient availability for dynamic recommendations.
- The system was evaluated using precision and recall, with future improvements focused on implementing a weighted scoring system and refining ingredient recognition.

### **Optimizing Airbnb Listing Success: A Data-Driven Analysis of Pricing, Location, Reviews, and Seasonality in Seattle**
- Analyzed Airbnb listing data from Seattle to determine key factors contributing to successful listings, such as pricing, location, reviews, and seasonality.
- Explored how proximity to major attractions boosts booking rates and how high-density areas in Seattle influence guest satisfaction.
- Investigated the impact of pricing strategies, revealing that entire homes and apartments command higher rates, while private rooms cater to budget-conscious travelers.
- Analyzed seasonality trends and found that booking rates peak during holidays and favorable weather conditions, influencing pricing and availability.
- Applied sentiment analysis to guest reviews using NLTK's VADER to categorize sentiment and identified the most common positive and negative feedback.
- Used linear regression models to recommend optimal pricing strategies based on seasonal trends and listing attributes, resulting in improved pricing decisions.
- Found that positive guest reviews, location, and pricing strategies significantly contribute to higher occupancy rates and better financial outcomes for Airbnb hosts.
